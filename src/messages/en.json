    "q1": {
      "question": "Is your notarization officially recognized?",

    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Can you visit my office or home?",
      "answer": "Absolutely — this is our key advantage. We can come to you anywhere within Abu Dhabi (office, home, or even hospital) at a time that suits you to complete the process."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "How long does the notarization take?",
      "answer": "Once the appointment is confirmed and the document draft is reviewed, notarization and signing are completed in the same session and you receive your notarized document immediately. The session usually takes no more than 15–30 minutes."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What documents are required for notarization?",
      "answer": "In general, a valid original Emirates ID is required for all signing parties, or a passport. Some special transactions (such as company contracts) may require additional documents, which will be clarified upon contact."
